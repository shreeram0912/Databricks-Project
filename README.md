# Databricks-Project

## Project Overview
- This project demonstrates how to build a governed, secure, and scalable data platform using Azure Databricks, Unity Catalog, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Event Hub.
- The goal is to solve common enterprise data challenges like:
  * Data scattered across multiple systems
  * Inconsistent access control
  * Difficulty discovering trusted data
  * Compliance and auditing issues
- This solution brings everything into one unified, governed data platform.

## Business Problems
* **1️⃣ Data Sprawl:** Data was stored in different systems and locations, There was no single, unified view of tables, models, or storage.
* **2️⃣ Inconsistent Access Control:**
    * Each system (cloud storage, database, workspace) had its own security model.
    * Permissions were managed separately, causing: Security gaps, Users seeing inconsistent data, Risk of unauthorized access
* **3️⃣ Data Discovery Challenges:** 
    * Teams struggled to: Search datasets, Understand data lineage, Track data quality
* **4️⃣ Compliance & Monitoring Challenges:** 
    * There was no centralized way to: Track user activity, Monitor data access, Audit usage logs

## Solution Architecture
This project uses Unity Catalog to provide:
* Centralized governance
* Role-based access control
* Data discovery (search, tags, lineage)
* Compliance monitoring through system tables
All data is organized into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

## 🥉 Bronze Layer – Data Ingestion
    Two data sources were used:
**1. Batch Processing – Azure SQL Database**
Connected using Databricks Lakeflow Connect, Data loaded into Unity Catalog -> Catalog
* workspace_databricksproject_catalog,
* Schema: 01_bronze
* Tables: Tables: customer_reviews, customers, historical_orders, menu_items, restaurants.csv

**2. Stream Processing – Azure Event Hub**
Connected using Databricks Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline, Real-time order data streamed into -> Catalog
* workspace_databricksproject_catalog,
* Schema: 01_bronze
* Tables: Tables: orders.csv
* Then: Merged real-time orders with historical_orders

## 🥈 Silver Layer – Data Transformation
Implemented using Databricks Declarative Pipeline
**1. Purpose:**
  * Clean raw data
  * Standardize formats
  * Apply business rules
  * Merge streaming + batch data
  * Prepare structured analytical tables
**2. Transformations include:**
  * Data validation
  * Deduplication
  * Joins between customers, restaurants, and orders
  * Schema standardization
  * This layer prepares data for business-level analytics.

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Business-Level Aggregations
Also built using Declarative Pipeline
1. Purpose: Create analytics-ready datasets for dashboards.
2. Includes:
  * Revenue calculations
  * Customer metrics
  * Sales performance
  * Aggregated KPIs
  * Sentiment analysis from reviews, This layer powers executive dashboards.

## Dashboards
Two interactive dashboards were created:
* **1️⃣ Restaurant Performance Dashboard**
  1. Filters: Date Range (Start Date – End Date)
  2. KPIs & Metrics: Total Orders, Total Revenue, Active Customers, AOV (Average Order Value) Unique Customers, Daily Sales, Best Selling Items, Order Volume by Day of Week, Peak Hour Analysis (Heatmap
                     by Day/Hour) Revenue by Order Type, Revenue by Food Category
    👉 Helps business understand sales trends and operational performance.

* **2️⃣ Customer Reviews Dashboard**
  **1. Filter:** Restaurant Name
  **2. KPIs & Insights:** Review Volume Over Time, Average Rating, City-wise Insights, Positive Review Count, Neutral Review Count, Negative Review Count, Sentiment Trend (Positive / Neutral / Negative
                          over time), Ratings Distribution
  **3. Issue Categorization:** Delivery, Food Quality, Pricing, Portion Size, Recent Review Feedback
    👉 Helps improve customer satisfaction and service quality.

## Governance with Unity Catalog
**1. This project demonstrates:**
  * Central Role-Based Access Control
  * Unified Data Governance
  * Data Lineage Tracking
  * Search & Discovery
  * Audit Logs via System Tables
  * Compliance Monitoring
**2. Unity Catalog ensures:**
  * The right people see the right data
  * Security is consistent across systems
  * Full observability of data usage
